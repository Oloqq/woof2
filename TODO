- scent visualization (enable/disable with a boolean flag)
- initialize Simulation in main to allow reading a config file
- allow running simulation at set frames (steps) per second
- allow running simulation at set amount of steps
- draw ui
  - sliders connected to simulation params
  - step button

simulation slow => refactor Simulation.agents into a hashmap
